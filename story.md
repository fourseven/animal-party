Once upon a time there was an animal party. The party was attended by a variety of different animals.
Including this very thiirrrsty llama.

Slow Loris was SO excited to have been invited to the party. "ME?" he said. "You invited me? Hooray!"

All of a sudden, Merrin the Mercat pops up. "Hellooo!" She squeaks.

The pug wanted a costume party...

Rube the Rabbit stares confused. "Coffeeeeeee"

And then Apollo Coffee came to the rescue. All the animals that had been sleepy felt wide awake.

"LET'S PARTY" said the fox. 

"It's my birthday", said Ruby, the Official Rails Girls Puppy.

It's a good thing some one thought to invite the chicken to the party, however the chicken wasn't too impressed by the suggestion she become a cake.
